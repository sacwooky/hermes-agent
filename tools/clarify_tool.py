Clarify Tool Module - Interactive Clarifying Questions

Allows the agent to present structured multiple-choice questions or open-ended
prompts to the user. In CLI mode, choices are navigable with arrow keys. On
messaging platforms, choices are rendered as a numbered list.

The actual user-interaction logic lives in the platform layer (cli.py for CLI,
gateway/run.py for messaging). This module defines the schema, validation, and
a thin dispatcher that delegates to a platform-provided callback.
